	for (Vector<Node*>::iterator it = _children.begin(); it != _children.end(); ++it)
	{
		Node* child = *it;
		child->onEnter();
	}
```
	
3. in order to run the built game in the vs2013, Open proj.win32\airbattledemo.sln with vs2013, 
```
	in the Project Property, Debugging, Set Working Directory: $(ProjectDir)../Resources,
